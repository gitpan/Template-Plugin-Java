Revision history for Perl extension Template::Plugin::Java.

0.01  Mon Jul 17 13:05:15 PDT 2000
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.20 with options
		-A -X -n Template::Plugin::Java

0.1   Thu Jul 27
	- First CPAN release.

0.2   Mon Jul 31 09:26:55 PDT 2000
	- The sql stuff now at least compiles and works for select queries.
	- Constructor for java.sql.Date called with (0) since the type has no
	  () constructor. This is a general problem that must be solved later
	  on using class file introspection.
	- Very minor documentation update.

0.3   Sat Aug  5 14:41:41 PDT 2000
	- DBClass.template now works for selects, stores and removes.
	- Small JavaSQL.pm and Java/Utils.pm update.

0.4   Mon Oct  9 23:01:34 PDT 2000
	- JavaSQL.pm didn't really parse queries correctly so the <query> tag
	  did not work for more complex queries, fixed.
	- Containers now fully parse themselves out of XML using SAX, no
	  dependencies on an XML parser you have to write.
	- Added a README.
	- Added nopackage="true" to java: context to allow creating classes
	  without a package.
	- Added support for SQL blob types.
	* Worked in support for java arrays. -- IN PROGRESS, only byte[] in
	  DBClass.
	- Templates are now installed in the make install process into
	  $(PREFIX)/share/tjava and compiled therein.
	- The "tjava" utility can now process files on standard input (i.e.
	  cat Foo.xml | tjava) will work.
	- Misc. annoyances fixed.
	* tjava can now take files in a directory other than the current -- IN
	  PROGRESS, very annoying bug
