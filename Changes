	- original version; created by h2xs 1.20 with options
		-A -X -n Template::Plugin::Java

0.1   Thu Jul 27
	- First CPAN release.

0.2   Mon Jul 31 09:26:55 PDT 2000
	- The sql stuff now at least compiles and works for select queries.
	- Constructor for java.sql.Date called with (0) since the type has no
	  () constructor. This is a general problem that must be solved later
	  on using class file introspection.
	- Very minor documentation update.
